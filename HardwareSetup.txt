------- Handy things to know for debugging -------

Turn on i2c interface so you can connect and run accessories off your RaspberryPi
https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-4-gpio-setup/configuring-i2c

> sudo raspi-config
-> i2c
-> enable


Check i2c connections and locations 
> sudo i2cdetect -y 1


Check GPIU
> gpio readall
