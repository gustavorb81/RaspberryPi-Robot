# Machine Learning on a Raspberry Pi Robot

Project goal is to set up an autonomous robot car. 

This is where it all started, though it hasn't been nearly as easy as he makes it sound 
( https://www.oreilly.com/learning/how-to-build-a-robot-that-sees-with-100-and-tensorflow )



Goals:
- autonomous tracking of pets
- recognize each of the two household cats
- autonomous movement around the house
- interactive voice 
- autonomous animated face ( eyes, ? ) 



Finished Parts:
- Robot learns to avoid obstacles using Reinforcement learning
- Robot can ID both the cats, if in photo, from photos it takes



WIP:
- waiting on Google AIY voice kit to see if it'll work for chat, notifications
- track cats ( robot can id each cat, or no cat, doesn't yet act on information )
- feedback ? face, text, some type of visual output
- loop to run obstacle avoidance, cat id, tracking, feedback all together
