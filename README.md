# Machine Learning on a Raspberry Pi Robot

Project goal is to set up an autonomous wheeled robot that can move about the house and track pets 

This is where it all started, though it hasn't been nearly as easy as he makes it sound

Finished Parts:
- robot learns to avoid obstacles using reinforcement learning with distance as the input
- robot can ID both the cats, if a cat in photo, from photos it takes



WIP:
- adapt the obstacle RL program to handle multiple inputs from various sensors
