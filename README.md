# Machine Learning on a Raspberry Pi Robot

Project goal is to set up an autonomous robot car. 

This is where it all started, though it hasn't been nearly as easy as he makes it sound

Goals:
- autonomous tracking of pets
- recognize each of the two household cats
- autonomous movement around the house
- interactive voice 
- autonomous animated face ( eyes, ? ) 



Finished Parts:
- robot learns to avoid obstacles using reinforcement learning with distance as the input
- robot can ID both the cats, if a cat in photo, from photos it takes



WIP:
- adapt the obstacle RL program to handle multiple inputs from various sensors
- waiting on Google AIY voice kit to see if it'll work for chat, notifications
- feedback ? face, text, some type of visual output
