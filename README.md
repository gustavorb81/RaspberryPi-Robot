# Machine Learning on a Raspberry Pi

Project goal is to set up a robot car with a camera to interact with household members and pets and provide home security. This is where it all started, though it hasn't been nearly as easy as he makes it sound ( https://www.oreilly.com/learning/how-to-build-a-robot-that-sees-with-100-and-tensorflow )

- autonomous motion tracking and following
- autonomously recognize human and pet residents
- interactive chat
- send notifications of problems when humans not in the house
- autonomous animated face ( eyes, ? ) 


SoftwareSetup.txt has links to any software I use along with any instructions needed to set it up

HardwareSetup.txt has links to detailed directions to get hardware running

PartsList.txt has parts listed as I acquire and add them

test*.py are simple scripts to make sure hardware is on and connecting to the RaspberryPi

Test hardware scripts contains very simple Python scripts to separately test robot hardware

Obstacle Avoidance uses reinforcement learning to train each robot wander around while avoiding obstacles

Tracking Scripts will store OpenCV scripts used to ID and follow or avoid humans and pets

Utility scripts are misc data cleaning and other random scripts that are necessary but not part of main project
