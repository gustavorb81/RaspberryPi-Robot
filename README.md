# Machine Learning on a Raspberry Pi

Project goal is to set up a robot car with a camera to interact with household members and pets and provide home security. This is where it all started, though it hasn't been nearly as easy as he makes it sound ( https://www.oreilly.com/learning/how-to-build-a-robot-that-sees-with-100-and-tensorflow )

- autonomous motion tracking and following
- autonomously recognize human and pet residents
- interactive chat
- send notifications of problems when humans not in the house
- autonomous animated face ( eyes, ? ) 


SoftwareSetup.txt has links to any software I use along with any instructions needed to set it up

HardwareSetup.txt will have links and detailed directions as I get things running

PartsList.txt has parts listed as I acquire and add them

test*.py are simple scripts to make sure hardware is on and connecting to the RaspberryPi

Obstacle Avoidance uses reinforcement learning to train each robot wander around while avoiding obstacles
