# Main Robot Loop

This section will contain the reinforcement network that allows the robot to respond to the environment

So far the robot's actions and input from sensors have been broken into classes

The robot loop will be built on the TF one that the robot uses to avoid obstacles but will 
use multiple sensor inputs not just distance.
