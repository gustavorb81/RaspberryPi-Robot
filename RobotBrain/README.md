# Main Robot Loop  (WIP)

This section will contain the reinforcement network that allows the robot to respond to the environment



The robot's actions and input from sensors have been broken into classes


<strike>The robot loop will be built on the TF one that the robot uses to avoid obstacles but will 
use multiple sensor inputs not just distance.</strike>

I gave up on the tf.contrib.slim library. The contrib libraries all work until you make the slightest change.



Everything is up and running. 


ToDo:

- speed things up 
- adjust rewards as needed
- adjust cost function as needed
- adjust network size if needed
