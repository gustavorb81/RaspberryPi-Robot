# RaspberryPi setup for ML
Machine Learning on a Raspberry Pi


-----     Setup     -----

RaspberryPi Software Guide (basic OS directions and images) 
https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/software-guide/quickstart/

Download SD Formatter
https://www.sdcard.org/

Download Raspbian
https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/

Download Etcher.io
https://etcher.io/


Insert SD card into your computer (16GB+)
- If your computer won't read it ( My Surface and iMac wouldn't see it)
--- Stick the card in a camera and format it
--- Then plug camera into computer and format with SD Formatter


Use the SD Formatter to do a full format
Use Etcher.io to flash the OS onto the card ( be sure to unzip Raspbian first )


-----     Install Machine Learning tools     -----

Install Mini Anaconda

Install TensorFlow
- First check to be sure you are using the Python V3.4 installed with Mini Anaconda
https://github.com/samjabrahams/tensorflow-on-raspberry-pi


-----     Setup camera    -----

Enable the camera
- Type raspi-config at a command prompt in the terminal
- Select 5. Interfacing options
- Select P1 Enable/Disable Camera
- Select 'Finish' to save changes and reboot

-----     Setup  Wifi, fixed ip and VNC   -----

Setup the wifi on the RaspberryPi
https://howtoraspberrypi.com/connect-wifi-raspberry-pi-3-others/


Set a fixed wireless ip on the RaspberryPi
https://www.modmypi.com/blog/how-to-give-your-raspberry-pi-a-static-ip-address-update

- edit /etc/dhcpcd.conf 
- add this to the bottom of the file, save it and reboot
* use your router ip and ip address, you can find these by typing ifconfig at a command prompt
#####
interface wlan0

static ip_address=192.168.0.200
static routers=192.168.0.1
static domain_name_servers=192.168.0.1
####


Set up a wireless VNC so you can access your RaspberriPi from your desktop computer
https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/docs/raspberry-pi.html#raspberry-pi-setup
user: pi
passwd: raspberry

Set the VNC to run at boot every time you start your RaspberryPi
> sudo systemctl enable vncserver-x11-serviced.service

Edit /boot/config.txt on RaspberryPi to get a full screen resolution on your desktop

----
hdmi_force_hotplug=1
hdmi_ignore_edid=0xa5000080
hdmi_group=2
hdmi_mode=16
----


Set Keyboard to US
> sudo vi /ect/default/keyboard
- change 'gb' to 'us' and save
